+
+Minimal requirements to compile the Kernel
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Intro
+=====
+
+This document is designed to provide a list of the minimum levels of
+software necessary to run the 4.x kernels.
+
+This document is originally based on my "Changes" file for 2.0.x kernels
+and therefore owes credit to the same people as that file (Jared Mauch,
+Axel Boldt, Alessandro Sigala, and countless other users all over the
+'net).
+
+Current Minimal Requirements
+****************************
+
+Upgrade to at **least** these software revisions before thinking you've
+encountered a bug!  If you're unsure what version you're currently
+running, the suggested command should tell you.
+
+Again, keep in mind that this list assumes you are already functionally
+running a Linux kernel.  Also, not all tools are necessary on all
+systems; obviously, if you don't have any ISDN hardware, for example,
+you probably needn't concern yourself with isdn4k-utils.

+
+Kernel compilation
+******************
+
+GCC
+---
+
+The gcc version requirements may vary depending on the type of CPU in your
+computer.
+
+Make
+----
+
+You will need GNU make 3.81 or later to build the kernel.
+
+Binutils
+--------
+
+The build system has, as of 4.13, switched to using thin archives (`ar T`)
+rather than incremental linking (`ld -r`) for built-in.a intermediate steps.
+This requires binutils 2.20 or newer.
+
+pkg-config
+----------
+
+The build system, as of 4.18, requires pkg-config to check for installed
+kconfig tools and to determine flags settings for use in
+'make {g,x}config'.  Previously pkg-config was being used but not
+verified or documented.
+
+Flex
+----
+
+Since Linux 4.16, the build system generates lexical analyzers
+during build.  This requires flex 2.5.35 or later.
+
+
+Bison
+-----
+
+Since Linux 4.16, the build system generates parsers
+during build.  This requires bison 2.0 or later.
+
+Perl
+----
+
+You will need perl 5 and the following modules: ``Getopt::Long``,
+``Getopt::Std``, ``File::Basename``, and ``File::Find`` to build the kernel.
+
+BC
+--
+
+You will need bc to build kernels 3.10 and higher
+
+
+OpenSSL
+-------
+
+Module signing and external certificate handling use the OpenSSL program and
+crypto library to do key creation and signature generation.
+
+You will need openssl to build kernels 3.7 and higher if module signing is
+enabled.  You will also need openssl development packages to build kernels 4.3
+and higher.
+
+
+System utilities
+****************
+
+Architectural changes
+---------------------
+
+DevFS has been obsoleted in favour of udev
+(http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/)
+
+32-bit UID support is now in place.  Have fun!
+
+Linux documentation for functions is transitioning to inline
+documentation via specially-formatted comments near their
+definitions in the source.  These comments can be combined with ReST
+files the Documentation/ directory to make enriched documentation, which can
+then be converted to PostScript, HTML, LaTex, ePUB and PDF files.
+In order to convert from ReST format to a format of your choice, you'll need
+Sphinx.
+
+Util-linux
+----------
+
+New versions of util-linux provide ``fdisk`` support for larger disks,
+support new options to mount, recognize more supported partition
+types, have a fdformat which works with 2.4 kernels, and similar goodies.
+You'll probably want to upgrade.
+
+Ksymoops
+--------
+
+If the unthinkable happens and your kernel oopses, you may need the
+ksymoops tool to decode it, but in most cases you don't.
+It is generally preferred to build the kernel with ``CONFIG_KALLSYMS`` so
+that it produces readable dumps that can be used as-is (this also
+produces better output than ksymoops).  If for some reason your kernel
+is not build with ``CONFIG_KALLSYMS`` and you have no way to rebuild and
+reproduce the Oops with that option, then you can still decode that Oops
+with ksymoops.
+
+Mkinitrd
+--------
+
+These changes to the ``/lib/modules`` file tree layout also require that
+mkinitrd be upgraded.
+
+E2fsprogs
+---------
+
+The latest version of ``e2fsprogs`` fixes several bugs in fsck and
+debugfs.  Obviously, it's a good idea to upgrade.
+
+JFSutils
+--------
+
+The ``jfsutils`` package contains the utilities for the file system.
+The following utilities are available:
+
+- ``fsck.jfs`` - initiate replay of the transaction log, and check
+  and repair a JFS formatted partition.
+
+- ``mkfs.jfs`` - create a JFS formatted partition.
+
+- other file system utilities are also available in this package.
+
+Reiserfsprogs
+-------------
+
+The reiserfsprogs package should be used for reiserfs-3.6.x
+(Linux kernels 2.4.x). It is a combined package and contains working
+versions of ``mkreiserfs``, ``resize_reiserfs``, ``debugreiserfs`` and
+``reiserfsck``. These utils work on both i386 and alpha platforms.
+
+Xfsprogs
+--------
+
+The latest version of ``xfsprogs`` contains ``mkfs.xfs``, ``xfs_db``, and the
+``xfs_repair`` utilities, among others, for the XFS filesystem.  It is
+architecture independent and any version from 2.0.0 onward should
+work correctly with this version of the XFS kernel code (2.6.0 or
+later is recommended, due to some significant improvements).
+
+PCMCIAutils
+-----------
+
+PCMCIAutils replaces ``pcmcia-cs``. It properly sets up
+PCMCIA sockets at system startup and loads the appropriate modules
+for 16-bit PCMCIA devices if the kernel is modularized and the hotplug
+subsystem is used.
+
+Quota-tools
+-----------
+
+Support for 32 bit uid's and gid's is required if you want to use
+the newer version 2 quota format.  Quota-tools version 3.07 and
+newer has this support.  Use the recommended version or newer
+from the table above.
+
+Intel IA32 microcode
+--------------------
+
+A driver has been added to allow updating of Intel IA32 microcode,
+accessible as a normal (misc) character device.  If you are not using
+udev you may need to::
+
+  mkdir /dev/cpu
+  mknod /dev/cpu/microcode c 10 184
+  chmod 0644 /dev/cpu/microcode
+
+as root before you can use this.  You'll probably also want to
+get the user-space microcode_ctl utility to use with this.
+
+udev
+----
+
+``udev`` is a userspace application for populating ``/dev`` dynamically with
+only entries for devices actually present. ``udev`` replaces the basic
+functionality of devfs, while allowing persistent device naming for
+devices.
+
+FUSE
+----
+
+Needs libfuse 2.4.0 or later.  Absolute minimum is 2.3.0 but mount
+options ``direct_io`` and ``kernel_cache`` won't work.
+
+Networking
+**********
+
+General changes
+---------------
+
+If you have advanced network configuration needs, you should probably
+consider using the network tools from ip-route2.
+
+Packet Filter / NAT
+-------------------
+The packet filtering and NAT code uses the same tools like the previous 2.4.x
+kernel series (iptables).  It still includes backwards-compatibility modules
+for 2.2.x-style ipchains and 2.0.x-style ipfwadm.
+
+PPP
+---
+
+The PPP driver has been restructured to support multilink and to
+enable it to operate over diverse media layers.  If you use PPP,
+upgrade pppd to at least 2.4.0.
+
+If you are not using udev, you must have the device file /dev/ppp
+which can be made by::
+
+  mknod /dev/ppp c 108 0
+
+as root.
+
+Isdn4k-utils
+------------
+
+Due to changes in the length of the phone number field, isdn4k-utils
+needs to be recompiled or (preferably) upgraded.
+
+NFS-utils
+---------
+
+In ancient (2.4 and earlier) kernels, the nfs server needed to know
+about any client that expected to be able to access files via NFS.  This
+information would be given to the kernel by ``mountd`` when the client
+mounted the filesystem, or by ``exportfs`` at system startup.  exportfs
+would take information about active clients from ``/var/lib/nfs/rmtab``.
+
+This approach is quite fragile as it depends on rmtab being correct
+which is not always easy, particularly when trying to implement
+fail-over.  Even when the system is working well, ``rmtab`` suffers from
+getting lots of old entries that never get removed.
+
+With modern kernels we have the option of having the kernel tell mountd
+when it gets a request from an unknown host, and mountd can give
+appropriate export information to the kernel.  This removes the
+dependency on ``rmtab`` and means that the kernel only needs to know about
+currently active clients.
+
+To enable this new functionality, you need to::
+
+  mount -t nfsd nfsd /proc/fs/nfsd
+
+before running exportfs or mountd.  It is recommended that all NFS
+services be protected from the internet-at-large by a firewall where
+that is possible.
+
+mcelog
+------
+
+On x86 kernels the mcelog utility is needed to process and log machine check
+events when ``CONFIG_X86_MCE`` is enabled. Machine check events are errors
+reported by the CPU. Processing them is strongly encouraged.

+ * Algorithm:
+ *
+ * 1) Given a word 'x', we can test to see if it contains any 0 bytes
+ *    by subtracting 0x01010101, and seeing if any of the high bits of each
+ *    byte changed from 0 to 1. This works because the least significant
+ *    0 byte must have had no incoming carry (otherwise it's not the least
+ *    significant), so it is 0x00 - 0x01 == 0xff. For all other
+ *    byte values, either they have the high bit set initially, or when
+ *    1 is subtracted you get a value in the range 0x00-0x7f, none of which
+ *    have their high bit set. The expression here is
+ *    (x - 0x01010101) & ~x & 0x80808080), which gives 0x00000000 when
+ *    there were no 0x00 bytes in the word.  You get 0x80 in bytes that
+ *    match, but possibly false 0x80 matches in the next more significant
+ *    byte to a true match due to carries.  For little-endian this is
+ *    of no consequence since the least significant match is the one
+ *    we're interested in, but big-endian needs method 2 to find which
+ *    byte matches.
+ * 2) Given a word 'x', we can test to see _which_ byte was zero by
+ *    calculating ~(((x & ~0x80808080) - 0x80808080 - 1) | x | ~0x80808080).
+ *    This produces 0x80 in each byte that was zero, and 0x00 in all
+ *    the other bytes. The '| ~0x80808080' clears the low 7 bits in each
+ *    byte, and the '| x' part ensures that bytes with the high bit set
+ *    produce 0x00. The addition will carry into the high bit of each byte
+ *    iff that byte had one of its low 7 bits set. We can then just see
+ *    which was the most significant bit set and divide by 8 to find how
+ *    many to add to the index.
+ *    This is from the book 'The PowerPC Compiler Writer's Guide',
+ *    by Steve Hoxey, Faraydon Karim, Bill Hay and Hank Warren.
